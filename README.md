# HBnB Evolution: Technical Blueprint
### Introduction
HBnB Evolution is a simplified version of a vacation rental platform. This document provides a comprehensive technical guide to the system architecture and design, serving as a foundation for the upcoming implementation phases.

---

## Problem Description
The HBnB project aims to solve the challenge of building a scalable and modular property management system. The primary goal is to ensure:
- Decoupling: Separation of presentation, logic, and data storage layers to improve maintainability.
- Consistency: Maintaining clear and logical relationships between users, places, and reviews.
- Scalability: Creating a robust design that allows for future enhancements with minimal refactoring.

---

## Project Tasks
This technical documentation is the result of completing the following foundational design tasks:
1. Task 0: Designing the High-Level Package Diagram to outline the layered architecture.
2. Task 1: Developing a Detailed Class Diagram for the Business Logic layer.
3. Task 2: Constructing Sequence Diagrams for key API interaction flows.
4. Task 3: Compiling all design elements into this comprehensive technical document.

## Design Diagrams

### 1. High-Level Package Diagram

Explanatory Notes:
- Presentation Layer: The entry point for the system via API calls.
- Business Logic Layer: Contains core models and validation rules.
- Persistence Layer: Responsible for all database interactions.

### 2. Detailed Class Diagram

Explanatory Notes:
- Core Entities: Defines User, Place, Review, and Amenity.
- BaseModel: Common parent class providing universal attributes like id and timestamps.

### Explanatory Note for Sequence Diagrams:
These diagrams illustrate the dynamic interaction between the system layers. 
They demonstrate how the Presentation Layer communicates with the Business Logic via a Facade, and how data is validated before being committed to the Persistence Layer.
Each flow ensures robust error handling and clear response status codes for all key API endpoints.

### 🛠 Tools Used

- draw.io – For creating UML diagrams.

- Mermaid.js – For code-based diagram generation.

- GitHub – For version control and documentation hosting.

---

### 📝 Notes

- All diagrams follow UML notation standards.

- The design is based on the given business rules and requirements.
